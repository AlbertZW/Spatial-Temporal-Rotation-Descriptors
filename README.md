# Advanced Skeleton-Based Action Recognition via Spatial-Temporal Rotation Descriptors
## Overview
![](./Rotation_descriptors.png)
**Figure (a)** shows the movement of the joint unit constructed on the shoulder at adjacent sample moments. In **Figure (b)**, angles of bias *θ* and *φ* denote the rotation axis *n*. The linear combination of angles *(θ, φ, ψ)* constructs **Rotation Angles Representation**. In **Figure (c)**, *α<sub>1</sub>, α<sub>2</sub>* are the internal angles between two bones *e<sub>m</sub>* and *e<sub>n</sub>* on the tangential direction and *β* is the angular difference between norm vectors *p*. The angular differences on the tangential and normal directions *α<sub>2</sub> − α<sub>1</sub>* and *β* construct **Two-Directional Difference Representation**.
